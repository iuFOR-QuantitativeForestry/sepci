    abstract = "{Several mathematical models for survivor tree growth were fitted, via nonlinear regression, to data from 17 permanent sample plots located in red pine plantations in Wisconsin. Simple empirical models provided slightly better fits for diameter growth, and much better fits for height growth than did semi-empirical or constrained model forms. A considerable improvement in diameter growth model fit was obtained by including a measure of competitive stress (competition index), although it made little difference if intertree distances were incorporated in the index. The best fit was obtained by simply using sample plot basal area as the measure of competitive stress. This observation was attributed in part to the typically uniform spatial pattern of the red pine plantations. No significant improvement in the height growth models could be obtained from the inclusion of a competition index. Data from two additional plots, not included in the regression analysis, provided a basis for comparing the fitted models. This comparison, together with a study of the residuals from the regression analysis, led the authors to conclude that the empirical model with a distance-independent competition index is the most accurate for diameter growth projections in managed plantations within the range of data. However, the semi-empirical model with a distance-independent index is likely to be more accurate for unmanaged stands and for extrapolating beyond the range of data. Forest Sci. 30:731-743.}",

    abstract = "{The model represents mathematically competitive interaction between individual trees. It consists of two basic components: (1) the influence zone of each tree (which is a function of its size) and (2) the amount and nature of interaction (which depends on the distance between and relativesize of the competing tree and its competitors and also on a power of relative tree sizes). Optimum model parameters were obtained by iterative procedures on a computer, combined with regression analyses for pure, even-aged, fully stocked stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)Franco), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), red pine (P. resinosa Ait.), and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and for an even-aged stand of Eucalyptus spp. growing at a range of stand densities. The model satisfactorily described competition effect for the five stands studied and accountedfor a greater portion of variation in tree growth than some of the earlier competition indices.

    abstract = "{The effect of competition on height and diameter² growth of individual conifer trees was examined. In this paper we modeled growth of individual trees as a product of potential growth reduced by competition. We investigated a number of competition indices that incorporate tree sizes and distances from neighbors, evaluated over varying competition zones. For these indices the reduction in mean square error relative to no competition index was used to judge performance. The performance of these indices varies by species and growth component (height or diameter² growth), but performance was generally better for tolerant white fir than for intolerant ponderosa pine. Additional competition measures that incorporate estimated crown parameters were developed and shown to improve on many of the traditional competition measures especially for ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. For white fir, basal area performed well, but not as well as the individual tree competition indices that incorporate estimated crown parameters. We found that expanding the search zone did not improve our ability to estimate competitive effects. Choosing competitors with a height angle gauge was generally superior to selecting them with a DBH angle gauge. Results are summarized by species, type of competition index, and competition evaluation zone. For. Sci. 38(3):695-720.}",

abstract = {Crown width is an important feature in describing stand density and individual tree competition. Two different approaches to using crown width in competition measures are reported in the literature: (i) crown width of open-grown trees, assumed to describe the zone of influence, and thus the potentially available stand area attributable to an individual tree and (ii) crown width of stand-grown trees, describing individual tree competition in distance-dependent individual tree growth models. The crown width measurements of the second Spanish National Inventory are used to derive (i) open-grown tree crown width equations and (ii) general tree crown width equations. The results show that the expectation that open-grown tree crown width may be derived as a special case of a general crown width equation is not met. Therefore, the authors sought a method of obtaining “compatible” tree crown width equations (modelled to a specific region and for individual tree species) that cover the range from open-grown to stand-grown trees with acceptable accuracy. As a practical example, the authors’ compatible tree crown width equations with their species-dependent coefficients are then compared for 11 major tree species in Spain in order to see if these equations give the open-grown tree crown width when open-grown tree height diameter ratio is inserted as independent variable. For conifers and for Eucalyptus globulus, the authors’ procedure does indeed provide equations valid for open-grown trees to stand-grown trees with an acceptable loss of efficiency over the range. For the other broad-leaved tree species, no recommendable compatible crown width equation could be derived.}

    abstract = "{We used data from Pinus pinaster Ait. and Pinus sylvestris L. trees growing in single-species even-aged stands in northwestern Spain to develop crown profile models. Such models are key components of growth and yield models, and they are also important for assessing competitive level, microclimate, tree vigour, mechanical stability, biological diversity, fire susceptibility and behaviour under wind stress, amongst other features. The equations used in crown profile estimation (i.e. those including crown radius, largest crown radius, height to the largest crown radius and height to the base of the live foliage) were fitted simultaneously to take into account correlations between the different variables. The fitting technique also enabled us to consider an autocorrelated, heteroscedastic error structure and to use a different number of observations for the different variables involved in the fitting process. The fitted models explained between 66 and 94 per cent of the variability in crown radius, with a mean error between 0.15 and 0.64 m. The crown profile models developed can be used to estimate the crown profile when only diameter at breast height, total tree height and height to the base of the live foliage are measured. Inclusion of more variables (such as largest crown radius) provides more accurate results.}",
